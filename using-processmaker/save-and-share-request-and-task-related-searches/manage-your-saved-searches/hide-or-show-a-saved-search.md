# Hide or Show a Saved Search

## Overview

{% hint style="info" %}
### ProcessMaker Package Required

To hide or show [Saved Searches](../what-is-a-saved-search.md), the [Saved Searches package](../../../package-development-distribution/package-a-connector/saved-searches-package.md) must be installed in your ProcessMaker instance. The Saved Searches package is not available in the ProcessMaker open-source edition. Contact [ProcessMaker Sales](mailto:sales@processmaker.com) or ask your ProcessMaker sales representative how the Saved Searches package can be installed in your ProcessMaker instance.
{% endhint %}

You may hide or show your own Saved Searches. However, you cannot hide or show Saved Searches which have been shared with you. You can only control visibility of Saved Searches that you have [created](../create-and-share-a-saved-search.md).

Hiding a Saved Search only hides it from the left sidebar for its specific Saved Search type. For example, toggling visibility of a Request-related Saved Search only affects the left sidebar on Request-related pages. Shared recipients of a Saved Search may still use that Saved Search to view search results.

Visible Saved Searches display above the **Edit Saved Searches** icon![](../../../.gitbook/assets/save-search-icon-package-requests-tasks.png).

## Hide Your Own Saved Search

You may hide only one of your own Saved Searches. Hiding a Saved Search only hides it from the left sidebar for its specific Saved Search type. For example, toggling visibility of a Request-related Saved Search only affects the left sidebar on Request-related pages. Shared recipients of a Saved Search may still use that Saved Search to view search results.

Follow these steps to hide one of your own Saved Searches:

1. [View the Shared Searches for a specific Saved Search type](./#manage-your-own-saved-searches). The **Edit Saved Searches** page displays.
2. Click the **Hide Saved Search** icon![](../../../.gitbook/assets/hide-saved-search-icon-package.png) for one of your Saved Searches. The Saved Search is hidden, indicated by diminished visibility of that Saved Search in the **Edit Saved Searches** page.

## Show Your Hidden Saved Search
