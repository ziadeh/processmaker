# Delete a Scheduled Interval to Email Reports

## Delete a Scheduled Interval to Email Reports

{% hint style="info" %}
### Don't Know What a Saved Search Is?

See [What is a Saved Search?](../../what-is-a-saved-search.md) to learn how you can share the same Request and Task search parameters with other ProcessMaker users in your organization.

### ProcessMaker Package Required

To delete a scheduled interval to email reports of a [Saved Search](../../what-is-a-saved-search.md)'s results, the [Saved Searches package](../../../../package-development-distribution/package-a-connector/saved-searches-package.md) must be installed in your ProcessMaker instance. The Saved Searches package is not available in the ProcessMaker open-source edition. Contact [ProcessMaker Sales](mailto:sales@processmaker.com) or ask your ProcessMaker sales representative how the Saved Searches package can be installed in your ProcessMaker instance.

Deleting a schedule stops the regular interval to email reports of that Saved Search's results. Deleting a schedule cannot be undone.

Use the **Pause** icon![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/pause-start-timer-event-element-icon-processes.png)to suspend the schedule of emailed reports for that Saved Search's results. You may then click the **Play** icon![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/play-start-timer-event-element-icon-processes.png)to resume the schedule if necessary. This is an alternative from permanently deleting the schedule.
{% endhint %}

Follow these steps to delete a scheduled interval to email reports of a Saved Search's search results:

1. [View the schedules to email reports of a Saved Search's results](../view-search-results-for-a-saved-search.md). The **Scheduled Reports** page displays for that Saved Search.
2. Click the **Delete** icon![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/trash-icon-process-modeler-processes.png)for the schedule in which to delete. The **Caution** screen displays to confirm the deletion of the schedule.
3. ~~Continue writing this procedure after the correct Caution screen displays.~~
4. Click **Confirm**.
