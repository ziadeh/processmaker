# Import a Collection

## Overview

Import a ProcessMaker Collection that has been [exported](export-a-collection.md) from the same [ProcessMaker version](../../using-processmaker/application-version-details.md#view-processmaker-version-information). The imported ProcessMaker Screen contains the [records](../manage-records-in-a-collection/view-all-records-in-a-collection.md#view-all-records-in-a-collection) and the [ProcessMaker Screens](../../designing-processes/design-forms/what-is-a-form.md) from the exported Collection. Exported ProcessMaker Collections have the `.json` file extension.
