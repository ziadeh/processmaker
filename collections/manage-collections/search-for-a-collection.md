# Search for a Collection

## Search for a ProcessMaker Collection

Use the **Search** function to filter all ProcessMaker [Collections](../what-is-a-collection.md) from the **Collections** page based on your entered text.

{% hint style="info" %}
### ProcessMaker Package Required

The [Collections package](../../package-development-distribution/package-a-connector/collections.md) must be installed in your ProcessMaker instance. The Collections package is not available in the ProcessMaker open-source edition. Contact [ProcessMaker Sales](mailto:sales@processmaker.com) or ask your ProcessMaker sales representative how the Collections package can be installed in your ProcessMaker instance.

### Permission Required

Your ProcessMaker user account or group membership must have the "Collections: View Collections" permission to view the list of ProcessMaker Collections unless your user account has the **Make this user a Super Admin** setting selected. This permission is different than [record permissions](configure-a-collection.md#configure-record-permissions-for-processmaker-users) in a ProcessMaker Collection that allow you to view the records in that Collection.

See the ProcessMaker [Collections](../../processmaker-administration/permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups.md#collections) permissions or ask your ProcessMaker Administrator for assistance.
{% endhint %}

Follow these steps to search for a ProcessMaker Collection:

1. [View your ProcessMaker Collections](view-collections.md#view-all-collections). The **Collections** page displays.
2. Enter in the **Search** field the text to filter by the ProcessMaker Collection name that displays in the **Name** column.

As you enter text into the **Search** field, ProcessMaker Collections display that match your entered text.

{% hint style="info" %}
If there are no search results, the following message displays: **No Data Available**.
