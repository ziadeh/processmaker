# View Users Accounts

## View All ProcessMaker User Accounts <a id="view-all-scripts"></a>

ProcessMaker displays all ProcessMaker user accounts in one table that ProcessMaker Administrators throughout your organization have created. This makes it easy to manage ProcessMaker user accounts.

{% hint style="info" %}
Your ProcessMaker user account or group membership must have the "Users: View Users" permission to view the list of users unless your user account has the **Make this user a Super Admin** setting selected.

See the [Users](../../permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups.md#users) permissions or ask your ProcessMaker Administrator for assistance.

Follow these steps to view all ProcessMaker user accounts in your organization:

1. [Log on](../../../using-processmaker/log-in.md#log-in) to ProcessMaker.
2. Click the **Admin** option from the top menu. The **Users** page displays all ProcessMaker user accounts.
