# What is Process Modeling?

## Overview

A Process is a set of steps and decisions to document how to complete a particular goal, often as efficiently as possible. Use ProcessMaker to design a model of a Process. The Process model is a graphical representation of a business workflow that ProcessMaker uses as the process definition. A Process may involve people or be completely automated through scripting. A Process can integrate with external third-party systems and legacy applications to extend their functionality. Use Process Modeler in ProcessMaker to design your Process model.

It’s easy for business analysts and business managers to model Processes. Business analysts and business managers understand the Processes that they use in their organizations, and they want to define and improve those Processes. For example, business analysts want to learn how much time and money is spent to do work in their organizations, and they want to improve those processes. In ProcessMaker, we refer to these business experts as “Process Owners.”

ProcessMaker follows Business Process Modeling Notation \(BPMN\) 2.0 specification established by the [Object Management Group](https://www.omg.org/) in 2011.

This document describes how to model Processes in ProcessMaker. However, it does not describe the BPMN 2.0 principles on which Process modeling is based. For more information about BPMN 2.0 see the [BPMN specification](https://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0/About-BPMN/).
