## View All Vocabularies

ProcessMaker displays all ProcessMaker [Vocabularies](../what-is-a-vocabulary.md) in one table. This makes it easy to manage ProcessMaker Vocabularies.

{% hint style="info" %}
### ProcessMaker Package Required

The [Vocabularies package](../../../package-development-distribution/package-a-connector/vocabularies.md) must be installed in your ProcessMaker instance. The Vocabularies package is not available in the ProcessMaker open-source edition. Contact [ProcessMaker Sales](https://www.processmaker.com/contact/) or ask your ProcessMaker sales representative how the Vocabularies package can be installed in your ProcessMaker instance.

### Permission Required

Your ProcessMaker user account or group membership must have the "Vocabularies: View Vocabularies" permission to view the list of ProcessMaker Vocabularies unless your user account has the **Make this user a Super Admin** setting selected.

See the ProcessMaker [Vocabularies](../../../processmaker-administration/permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups.md#vocabularies) permissions or ask your ProcessMaker Administrator for assistance.

The **Vocabularies** page displays the following information in tabular format about ProcessMaker Vocabularies:

* **Title:** The **Title** column displays the ProcessMaker Vocabulary's name.
* **Description:** The **Description** column displays the ProcessMaker Vocabulary's description.
* **Modified:** The **Modified** column displays the date and time the ProcessMaker Vocabulary was last modified. The time zone setting to display the time is according to the ProcessMaker instance unless your [user profile's](../../../using-processmaker/profile-settings.md#change-your-profile-settings) **Time zone** setting is specified.
* **Created:** The **Created** column displays the date and time the ProcessMaker Vocabulary was created. The time zone setting to display the time is according to the ProcessMaker instance unless your [user profile's](../../../using-processmaker/profile-settings.md#change-your-profile-settings) **Time zone** setting is specified.
