# What is a Screen?

## Overview

In ProcessMaker, a Screen presents information for a person to interact with or view. A form is an example of a ProcessMaker Screen. Any ProcessMaker Screen can be re-used in any Process. Many Processes require the same type of information be gathered, such as a person's name, email address, and other business information. In other words, "design once, use anywhere."

In simple forms, ProcessMaker Screens can display information. However, ProcessMaker Screens also allow people to interact with [Request](../../using-processmaker/requests/what-is-a-request.md) information. Below are a few ways Request participants can interact with ProcessMaker Screens:

* Enter information into a Request.
* Review information and then approve or reject a Request.
* Upload or download documents as attachments to a Request.
* Display information from [ProcessMaker Script](../scripts/what-is-a-script.md) output.

There are many ways Process Owners design ProcessMaker Screens to meet the needs of their Processes. Savvy Process Owners design ProcessMaker Screens for multiple re-use across their organizations.
