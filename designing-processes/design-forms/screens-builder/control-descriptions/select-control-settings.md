# Select Control Settings

## Control Description

The Select control provides a drop-down menu from which the [Request](../../../../using-processmaker/requests/what-is-a-request.md) participant selects a single option.

{% hint style="info" %}
This control is not available for [Display](../types-for-screens.md#display)-type ProcessMaker Screens. See [Screen Types](../types-for-screens.md).
{% endhint %}

## Add the Control to a ProcessMaker Screen

{% hint style="info" %}
Your ProcessMaker user account or group membership must have the following permissions to add a control to a ProcessMaker Screen unless your user account has the **Make this user a Super Admin** setting selected:

* Screens: View Screens
* Screens: Edit Screens

See the ProcessMaker [Screens](../../../../processmaker-administration/permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups.md#screens) permissions or ask your ProcessMaker Administrator for assistance.
{% endhint %}

Follow these steps to add this control to the ProcessMaker Screen:

1. [Create a new ProcessMaker Screen](../../manage-forms/create-a-new-form.md) or click the **Edit** icon![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/edit-icon.png)to edit the selected Screen. The ProcessMaker Screen is in [Design mode](../screens-builder-modes.md#editor-mode).
2. View the ProcessMaker Screen page to which to add the control.
3. Locate the **Select** icon![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/select-control-screens-builder-processes.png)in the panel to the left of the Screens Builder canvas.
4. Drag the **Select** icon into the Screens Builder canvas. Existing controls on the Screens Builder canvas adjust positioning based on where you drag the control.
5. Place into the Screens Builder canvas where you want the control to display on the ProcessMaker Screen.

6. Configure the Select control. See [Settings](select-control-settings.md#inspector-settings).
7. Validate that the control is configured correctly. See [Validate Your Screen](../validate-your-screen.md#validate-a-processmaker-screen).

Below is a Select control in [Preview mode](../screens-builder-modes.md#preview-mode).

## Delete the Control from a ProcessMaker Screen

{% hint style="warning" %}
Deleting a control also deletes configuration for that control. If you add another control, it will have default settings.
{% endhint %}

Click the **Delete** icon![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/delete-screen-control-screens-builder-processes.png)for the control to delete it.

## Settings <a id="inspector-settings"></a>

{% hint style="info" %}
Your user account or group membership must have the following permissions to edit a ProcessMaker Screen control:

* Screens: View Screens
* Screens: Edit Screens

See the ProcessMaker [Screens](../../../../processmaker-administration/permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups.md#screens) permissions or ask your ProcessMaker Administrator for assistance.
{% endhint %}

The Select control has the following panels that contain settings:

* \*\*\*\*[**Variable** panel](select-control-settings.md#variable-panel-settings)
* \*\*\*\*[**Design** panel](select-control-settings.md#design-panel-settings)

### Variable Panel Settings

Click the control while in [Design](../screens-builder-modes.md#design-mode) mode, and then click the **Variable** panel that is on the right-side of the Screens Builder canvas.

Below are settings for the Select control in the **Variable** panel:

* **Variable Name:** Enter a unique name containing at least one letter that represents this control's value. Use the **Variable Name** value in the following ways:

  * Reference this control by its **Variable Name** setting's value. The **Data Preview** panel in [Preview mode](../screens-builder-modes.md#preview-mode) corresponds the Select control's selected option with that Select control's **Variable Name** value. In the example below, `SelectControl` is the **Variable Name** setting's value. ![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/select-preview-screens-builder-processes.png) 
  * Reference this control's value in a different Screens Builder control. To do so, use mustache syntax and reference this control's **Variable Name** value in the target control. Example: `{{ SelectControl }}`.
  * Reference this value in [**Visibility Rule** setting expressions](expression-syntax-components-for-show-if-control-settings.md).

  This is a required setting.

* **Validation:** Enter the validation rules the form user must comply with to properly enter a valid value into this field. This setting has no default value. See [Validation Rules for "Validation" Control Settings](validation-rules-for-validation-control-settings.md).
* **Options List:** Enter the list of options available in the select box. Add options in the order they are to display from top to bottom in the drop-down menu. The default option is called **new** with the content **New Option**.

  Switch the **Show in Json Format** toggle key to display these settings in JSON.  

  ![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/select-control-options-list-screens-builder-processes.png)

  Each option has the following settings:

  * **Value:** **Value** is the internal data name for the option that only the Process Owner views at design time.
  * **Content:** **Content** is the option label displayed to the form user. 
  * **Actions:** Click the **Remove**![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/options-list-delete-option-icon-screens-builder-processes.png)icon to remove the option.

  Follow these steps to add an option: 

  1. Click **Add Option** from below the **Options List** setting. The **Add New Option** screen displays.  

     ![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/add-new-option-screen-screen-builder-processes.png)

  2. In the **Option Value** field, enter the **Value** option value \(as described above\).
  3. In the **Content** field, enter the **Content** option value \(as described above\).
  4. Click **OK**. The option displays below the existing options in **Options List**.

### Design Panel Settings

Click the control while in [Design](../screens-builder-modes.md#design-mode) mode, and then click the **Design** panel that is on the right-side of the Screens Builder canvas.

Below are settings for the Select control in the **Design** panel:

* **Field Label:** Enter the field label text that displays. **New Select** is the default value.
* **Help Text:** Enter text that provides additional guidance on the field's use. This setting has no default value.
* **Element Background Color:** Select to specify the background color of this control.
* **Text Color:** Select to specify the text color that displays in this control.
* **Visibility Rule:** Specify an expression that indicates the condition\(s\) under which this control displays. See [Expression Syntax Components for "Visibility Rule" Control Settings](expression-syntax-components-for-show-if-control-settings.md#expression-syntax-components-for-show-if-control-settings). If this setting does not have an expression, then this control displays by default.
* **CSS Selector Name:** Enter the value to represent this control in custom CSS syntax when in [Custom CSS](../add-custom-css-to-a-screen.md#add-custom-css-to-a-processmaker-screen) mode. As a best practice, use the same **CSS Selector Name** value on different controls of the same type to apply the same custom CSS style to all those controls.
