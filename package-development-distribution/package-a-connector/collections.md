# Collections Package

## Overview

{% hint style="info" %}
The Collections [package](../first-topic.md) is not available in the ProcessMaker open-source edition. Contact [ProcessMaker Sales](https://www.processmaker.com/contact/) or ask your ProcessMaker sales representative how the Collections package can be installed in your ProcessMaker instance.
{% endhint %}

Use the Collections package to maintain sets of schema-less data records using [ProcessMaker Screens](../../designing-processes/design-forms/what-is-a-form.md), each referred to as a [ProcessMaker Collection](../../collections/what-is-a-collection.md). The Collections package has the following features:

* An external database is not required to store ProcessMaker Collections. ProcessMaker Collections are maintained in the ProcessMaker instance.
* Define the record using ProcessMaker Screens, which makes it easy for any ProcessMaker [user](../../processmaker-administration/add-users/what-is-a-user.md) to view, create, or edit record data if they have the [appropriate permission\(s\)](../../processmaker-administration/permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups.md#collections) to do so.
* The Collections package integrates with the [Saved Searches](../../using-processmaker/save-and-share-request-and-task-related-searches/what-is-a-saved-search.md) and [Data Connector](../../designing-processes/data-connector-management/what-is-a-data-connector.md) packages:
  * **Saved Searches package:** Use the Saved Searches package to save and share searches. See [Saved Searches Package](saved-searches-package.md).
  * **Data Connector package:** Access both ProcessMaker Collection records and third-party data sources from any ProcessMaker asset, including ProcessMaker Screens, [ProcessMaker Scripts](../../designing-processes/scripts/what-is-a-script.md), and [Process](../../designing-processes/viewing-processes/what-is-a-process.md) models. See [Data Connector Package](data-connector-package.md).
