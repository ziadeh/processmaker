# SAML Package

## Overview

{% hint style="info" %}
The SAML [package](../first-topic.md) is not available in the ProcessMaker open-source edition. Contact [ProcessMaker Sales](https://www.processmaker.com/contact/) or ask your ProcessMaker sales representative how the SAML package can be installed in your ProcessMaker instance.
{% endhint %}

Use the Security Assertion Markup Language \(SAML\) package to allow ProcessMaker users to log on and off from your ProcessMaker instance using a single account within your organization. This is referred to as Single sign-on \(SSO\). For example, if your organization uses Google to authenticate people in your organization, ProcessMaker users in your organization authenticate into your ProcessMaker instance using their Google credentials.
